Since Sass is a preprocessor the code itself is not understood by a web browser.
The only way to use the code is to export it to a .css file. 
We were able to accomplish that by adding a sass gem package to Ruby. 
From there we just load up the Ruby Command Prompt and tell it which file has the input and which 
file we want the ouput to. Then you use the watch feature to check whether the file contents have been changed. 

To edit: 
Think about Sass like nesting Css selectors. For example instead of typing -
a {
    color: red; 
}

a:hover {
    color: blue;
}

We can just write:
a {
    color: red;
    &:hover {
        color: blue;
    }
}

We are also able to use variables, functions, and loops.

To change things without using Sass:
Just go to the final_style.css file in the Sass folder and edit that way.
The code isn't the easiest to read as some things are squished but that's just because its the output of the
final_sass.scss file.
