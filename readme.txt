in web development.

Technology: Fetch
According to developer.mozilla.org, Fetch provides a generic definition of Request and Response objects (and other things involved with network requests).
In layman's terms, it makes it easier to do API calls without having to resort to AJAX. It is also much more readable and easily understood.
As it uses promises, it is great for async functions.
